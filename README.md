# raytriangle-test

Ray-triangle intersection performance tests in various languages using a simple direct implementation of the [Möller–Trumbore
intersection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm).

See `results.txt` for the raw test results or read the [accompanying article](https://blog.johnnovak.net/2017/04/22/nim-performance-tuning-for-the-uninitiated/) for a discussion of the testing method and the interpretation of results.
